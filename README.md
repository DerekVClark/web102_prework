## Notes

- Challenge 7 was a bit confusing I had figured out a couple different ways to get the same results but wasnt sure how the question wanted me to solve it especially using the spread syntax.
- My other challenging parts were mostly grammatical errors typing the variables wrong or using the wrong variables.
- Although I was able to figure it out in the begining using arrow functions for the first time was a bit confusing but manageable and I was able to overcome that obstacle.
